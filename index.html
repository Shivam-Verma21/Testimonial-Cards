            <p>I find myself recommending roadmap.sh to all the internees or junior developers. It's a great way to skill up and grow in your career.</p>

            roadmap.sh is an incredible resource. I was fortunate to discover it
            during my university days in 2018. Back then, it was just a single
            repository with three images. It's amazing to see how much impact it
            has had on millions of lives since then.
